abstract = "Occupant satisfaction with IEQ (indoor environmental quality) is influenced by many physical and psychological factors. This paper reports the results of a study that investigate influential office design factors on occupant satisfaction relating environmental dimensions such as thermal and visual comfort in workplaces and predicting which design parameters may bring better satisfaction to occupants. Five office cases in the Netherlands with 579 office occupants were studied using questionnaires, and interviews with facility managers and architects. Different statistical analysis tests were conducted to summarise satisfaction factors. Results show that ‘desk location’ and ‘layout’ contributed most to occupant's satisfaction with thermal and visual comfort regardless of seasons. In summer, ‘orientation’ was exceptionally considered as an important factor for satisfaction with thermal comfort. This study revealed that categorical and regression analyses are required to predict profound outcomes when the data are nominal and categorical variables. This study contributes to develop design solutions, which could improve occupants' environmental satisfaction in workplaces."

abstract = "Office employees spend a lot of their time inside a building, where the physical environments influence their well-being and directly influence their work performance and productivity. In the workplace, it is often assumed that employees who are more satisfied with the physical environment are more likely to produce better work outcomes. Temperature, air quality, lighting and noise conditions in the office affect the work concentration and productivity. Numerous studies have consistently demonstrated that characteristics of the physical office environment can have a significant effect on behaviour, perceptions and productivity of employees. Most of the previous researchers in their studies are more focused on a single factor that could give an effect on employee‘s performance at work. However, no study was done to examine the relationships between the whole factors of physical office environment and employees ‘performance. Therefore this paper presents a literature review of several environmental factors which directly or indirectly affect employees work performance. Several factors of environments such as the effects of workplace design, indoor temperature, colour, noise and also interior plants towards employees well-being and performance have been discussed."

The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II (Comfort Database), now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying “right-here-right-now” subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information. Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data."

The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, the largest of its kind, was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the PMV/PPD model. We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34%, meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25% outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models. For demonstration, we developed a simple thermal prediction model just based on air temperature and its accuracy, for this database, was higher than PMV."

This paper aims to list and examine the magnitude and significance of individual difference in the preferred/neutral/comfort temperature through reviewing previous climate chamber and field studies. Causal factors for individual differences are investigated, including sex, age and etc. There is no clear and consistent conclusions as to the significance and size of inter-group differences in thermal comfort (between females and males, or the young and the old). To address the issue of individual difference, a paradigm shift from centralized to personalized air condition is on the way with the following three steps: first, collecting individual physiological and psychological response; second, predict individual comfort with machine learning algorithms; and third, accommodating individual difference with Personalized Comfort Systems.",

These systems create a microenvironment adapted for each user. Therefore, individual demands for thermal comfort can be met and energy can be saved due to higher effectiveness compared to the traditional HVAC systems. This study investigates two aspects of personalized heating – effectiveness of different heaters and impact of different control modes. Personalized heating system consisting of a heated chair, a heated desk mat, and a heated floor mat was tested with 13 test subjects in a climate chamber under operative temperature of 18 °C. The heaters were tested separately and in combination as user controlled. Furthermore, the complete system was tested with fixed setting and automatic control using hand skin temperature as a control signal. The heated chair and the heated desk mat as well as the complete system significantly improved thermal comfort, while the heated chair was found to the most effective heater. The automatic control mode could provide the same level of thermal comfort as user control in this study."
